# Enhanced Logging System Implementation Plan

## Development Approach

### Core Principles
1. **Minimal Viable Changes (MVC)**
   - Make the smallest possible change that moves us forward
   - Verify each change before proceeding
   - Avoid scope creep in individual changes

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Work in small, testable increments
   - Each change should be independently verifiable
   - Maintain a working version at all times

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Manual verification after each significant change
   - Document test cases before implementation
   - Plan to add automated tests in future iterations

4. **Debugging Protocol**
   - If debugging takes >15 minutes, revert and try a different approach
   - Keep detailed notes of issues and solutions
   - Maintain a known-good version to compare against

5. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with each change
   - Keep track of decisions and their rationale
   - Document any workarounds or temporary solutions
